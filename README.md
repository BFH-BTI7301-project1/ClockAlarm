# ClockAlarm : Projet Vision
The goal of this project is to develop a replacement for the
program „kAlarm“ distributed with the KDE desktop
environment.

The program kAlarm allows the user to define some events
(possibly recurrent) and display alarms using pop-up windows
on the screen at times defined by the event. The project should
develop an alternative to this tool, which is platform
independent and open-source.

**Must have goals:** recurrent events, persistence, event
categories, external configuration file, database independent,
operating system independent

**Nice to have goals:** Sub-repetition of events, starting commands
at event time, internationalization, user can change fonts and
colours of the pop-up windows, iCalendar import.
