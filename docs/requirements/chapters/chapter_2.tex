\chapter{Project Vision}

The goal of this project is to develop a replacement for the
program „kAlarm“ distributed with the KDE desktop
environment.

The program kAlarm allows the user to define some events
(possibly recurrent) and display alarms using pop-up windows
on the screen at times defined by the event. The project should
develop an alternative to this tool, which is platform
independent and open-source.
