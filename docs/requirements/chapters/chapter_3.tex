\chapter{Project goals}

The new ClockAlarm software must handle recurrent events, system shutdown (persistence), and mustn't rely on an online database. The software has to be cross platform.\\
The user must be able to categorise the events, personalize the notifications layout and import/export a configuration file.\\
\\
As nice to have goals, the user should be able to delay a notification, to setup recurrent events (sub-repetition) or setup events/commands starting at an ulterior time. Internationalization, advanced personalization or iCalendar importation are other features to consider.
