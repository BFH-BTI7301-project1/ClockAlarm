	Abstract = {In practice, requirements engineering tasks become more and more complex. In order to ensure a high level of knowledge and training, the International Requirements Engineering Board (IREB) worked out the training concept ``Certified Professional for Requirements Engineering'', which defines a requirements engineer's practical skills on different training levels. The book covers the different subjects of the curriculum for the ``Certified Professional for Requirements Engineering'' (CPRE) defined by the International Requirements Engineering Board (IREB). It supports its readers in preparing for the test to achieve the ``Foundation Level'' of the CPRE.},
