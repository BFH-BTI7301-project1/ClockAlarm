Present at meeting
==================
    - Everyone

Agenda
======
    - Present Use Cases / Uses stories
    - Discussion about the usage of Python

Notes
=====
    - Present Use Cases / Uses stories:
        * Vision&Goals: The vision and goals of the project have to be enhanced
          and not taken "as is".
        * If a choice is made during the project, we should write down why it
          has been made this way. Everything that hasn't been documented is
          considered not been done.
        * If we go for a specific product (such as DBMS, module, etc.) we should
          at least try out other alternatives (2-3) and explain why we made the
          choice of using this specific product.
        * Split the user story "create/delete categories" in two.
        * Sort the uses cases by topic.
        * Alarms could be snoozed. (for example, if the user is at a meeting
          snooze all alarms so that they don't disturb the meeting) 
        * Alarms should be user specific, i.e., they should belong to the user
          connected on the computer and not be shared across all the users of
          the machine.
        * Book recommendation (chapter about use cases) -> Applying UML and
          Patterns (Larman).
    - Discussion about the usage of Python:
        * Strongly discouraged to share python code via e-mail (General life
          advice)
        * Code coverage ~70-80% is ok, ~30% is not
