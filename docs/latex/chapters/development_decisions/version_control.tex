\section{Version Control}

Out of the multitude of \glspl{vcs} which exist, the
three following are mostly used~\cite{rhodecodeVCS}:

\begin{enumerate} \item \gls{git} \item \gls{mercurial} \item \gls{svn}
\end{enumerate}

All the three offer equivalent features and are equally well suited for our
project~\cite{thomson2008relax}. We decided to use \gls{git} with \gls{github}
mainly because we were already familiar with them. \Gls{github} allows us to
easily manage issues and milestones (an equivalent service for mercurial is
\gls{bitbucket}).
