        easily transferable from one computer to another.
    \item The user should be given the option to customise the layout of his
        alerts.
    \item Alerts should be classifiable so that the user does not lose sight of
        them.
    \item The user can schedule alerts so that he is notified at the given date
        and time.
    \item Alerts should have the possibility to be recurrent so that the

    \item The user should be able to snooze alerts when he does not want to be
        disturbed.
