\subsection*{Agenda}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Show version with a simple notification
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Notes}

The \texttt{setup.py} is useful for bigger projects but in our case it
is not. If we have time at the end then we should implement it.

The autostart function should be cared of only at the very end of the
project.  Users can do it themselves at the moment. More important are the
persistence and customization features.

\textbf{Question:} Should we create one thread for every alarm or one
thread for the hole program?

\textbf{Answer:} The best solution is to create one thread for the hole
program that checks the due time ever 30 seconds or every minute.

Logging is useful and should be preferred instead of simple prints
because it is possible to disable it completely for a project.

\subsection*{Tasks}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Document Use Case ``Notification Center''.
        \item Write the encountered development problems in the documentation.
    \end{itemize}
