\section{Unimplemented Requirements}\label{sec:unimplreq}

Due to the time constraint the following requirements could not be fulfilled:

\begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Alert categories:}
        \fullref{subsec:usecase_add_category},
        \fullref{subsec:usecase_delete_category},
        \fullref{subsec:usecase_edit_category},
        \fullref{subsec:usecase_mute_category},
        \fullref{subsec:usecase_unmute_category}, Q.2.2 The main user interface
        shall contain buttons to create, edit, delete categories, Q.2.6 The user
        shall be able to sort the alerts by category, by due date and
        alphabetically.

    \item \textbf{Email alert:}
        \fullref{subsec:usecase_add_email_sender},
        \fullref{subsec:usecase_delete_email_sender},
        \fullref{subsec:usecase_edit_email_sender}. These requirements do not
        really make sense because they allready exist in Outlook\footnote{\url{
                https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Delay-or-schedule%
                -sending-email-messages-026af69f-c287-490a-a72f-6c65793744ba}}
                and Thunderbird\footnote{\url{https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/%
                thunderbird/addon/send-later-3/?src=search}}

     \item \textbf{Snooze alert:}
         \fullref{subsec:usecase_snooze_alert}

     \item \textbf{Auto start:}
         \fullref{subsec:usecase_auto_start}, T.4 The application shall still be
         running after a system reboot.


\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{SimpleAlert class}

The existence of a \texttt{SimpleAlert} and \texttt{Alert} class can seem to be
unoptimized at first glance. The two classes could have been merged together.
But in our initial development decisions, we planned to add another class
extending \texttt{Alert}, namely \texttt{EmailAlert}. We decided to leave the
design like it is now, so that it is easier to create a custom alert class in
the future.
