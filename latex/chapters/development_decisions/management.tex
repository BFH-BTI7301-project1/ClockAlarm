\section{Management}

To generate the Gantt Chart we used
TaskJuggler\footnote{\url{http://taskjuggler.org}} because it free and cross
platform compared to Microsoft Project. We considered other alternatives like
GanttProject\footnote{\url{http://www.ganttproject.biz}} or
ProjectLibre\footnote{\url{http://www.projectlibre.com}} but we were not really
pleased with the user interface and user friendliness.
