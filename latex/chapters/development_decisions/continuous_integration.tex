\section{Continuous Integration}

We chose to use Travis
\footnote{\url{https://travis-ci.org/BFH-BTI7301-project1/ClockAlarm}}, the
continuous integration service. Every time a commit is made, the entire project
is build and the tests are run. Then the report is sent to
Coveralls\footnote{\url{https://coveralls.io/github/BFH-BTI7301-project1/%
ClockAlarm?branch=master}}. This approach allows us to have a better
development workflow.
