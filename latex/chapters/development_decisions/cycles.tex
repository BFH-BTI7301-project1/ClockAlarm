\section{Cycles}
\label{sec:cycles}

As already mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:documentation} Sphinx made us aware of
cycles in our code:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item \texttt{SimpleAlert}~$\rightlcurvearrow$~\texttt{main}
        $\rightlcurvearrow$~\texttt{AlertCollction}~$\rightlcurvearrow$
        \texttt{SimpleAlert}

        The \texttt{SimpleAlert} class was directly accessing
        the \texttt{AlertCollection} inside of \texttt{main} to
        delete \texttt{SimpleAlert}s or update periodic \texttt{SimpleAlert}s.
        The code doing the \texttt{SimpleAlert} update and delete has been moved
        to the \texttt{check\_timers(self, trig\_time)} method inside of
        \texttt{AlertCollection}.

    \item \texttt{AlertCollection}~$\rightlcurvearrow$~\texttt{main}
        $\rightlcurvearrow$~\texttt{AlertCollection}

        The \texttt{display(self)} method in \texttt{AlertCollection} triggered
        the actualization method of the \texttt{UI.AlertListWidget} from the
        \texttt{App} in \texttt{main}.

\end{enumerate}
