\section{Sound}

We had an issue on macOS and linux when using PyQt's \texttt{QSound} class.
\texttt{QSound} uses the default OS specific sound library to play the sound
(NSSound for macOS and \gls{nasl} for X11 used on linux). The \texttt{wav} file
only played on Windows but not on macOS nor linux.

An easier and much cleaner alternative was found using pygame's \texttt{mixer}.
