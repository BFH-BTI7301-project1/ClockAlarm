\section{Python}

As two teams separately develop a similar \gls{kalarm} project, the decision was
made to realize our project in python.

\gls{python} is a relatively old programming language, as it appeared in 1991.
This makes \gls{python}'s libraries extremely numerous and diversified.
However, many of them are no longer updated. \gls{python} has a simple and easy
to learn syntax. It is object-oriented and cross-platform. It was mainly
designed for prototyping, which means that it is possible to obtain a functional
and efficient code in a minimum amount of time.

\gls{python}'s detractors reproach it its lack of security mechanisms compared
to traditional languages. Indeed, \gls{python} follows the philosophy of
Linux, which count on a solid OS capable of protecting the code it uses, not a
code that protects itself.
