As two teams separately developed a similar \gls{kalarm} project, the decision was made to realize our project in python.

\gls{python} is a relatively old programming language, as it appeared in 1991. This makes the \gls{python}'s libraries extremely numerous and diversified. However, many of them are no longer updated. \gls{python} has a simple easy to learn syntax. It is object-oriented and cross-platform. It was mainly disigned for prototyping, which means that it is possible to obtain a functional and efficient code in a minimum amound of time.

\gls{python}'s detractors reproach it his lack of security mechanisms compared with traditional languages. Indeed, \gls{python} follows the philosophy of Linux, which count on a solid OS capable of protecting the code it uses, not a code that protects itself.
