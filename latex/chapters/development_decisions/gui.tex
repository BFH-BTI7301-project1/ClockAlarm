\section{GUI}

As our application has to run on multiple platforms, the GUI framework should
also support multiple platforms. The framework should also support Python 3. The
Python wiki lists over 35 frameworks, many of those target \gls{qt}. We have chosen
only three that were recommended by the
\citetitle{schlusser2016hitchhikers}~\cite{schlusser2016hitchhikers}:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item PySide
    \item PyQt
    \item Tk
\end{enumerate}

PySide, as PyQt, provides a binding to the \gls{qt} framework. The main difference
between the two is the license: PySide uses the \acrfull{lgpl} whereas PyQt uses
the \acrfull{gpl}. Which means that source code licensed under the
\acrshort{gpl} must be opensource. On the other hand the
\acrshort{lgpl} is more suited for closed source projects. In addition PyQt
supports Python 3. Tk provides bindings to the Tk framework and is licensed
under a \acrfull{bsd} license.

We chose the PyQt framework out of personal preference. All three frameworks
are equally well suited for a project like this one.
