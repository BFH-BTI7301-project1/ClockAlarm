\section{System Notifications}

We first tried to use the OS specific system notification API.\@With this
solution we didn't have to care were the notifications would appear on the
screen. They would always be at the correct position on every platform. There is
however one drawback: the notifications cannot be fully customized. Only the
icon can be changed but the typeface and the sound cannot. This is why we choose
to develop our own notification system, \texttt{Notification.py}, where
notifications can be fully customized.
