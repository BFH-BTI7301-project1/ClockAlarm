\section{Code Coverage}

There is at the moment only one maintained mature tool for measuring the code
coverage in Python: Coverage.py.\footnote{Nose provides code coverage but it is
deprecated and being replaced by nose2, still under development.} ``It monitors
your program, noting which parts of the code have been executed, then analyzes
the source to identify code that could have been executed but was
not.''\cite{coveragePY} It also provides clean and readable annotated html
reports.
